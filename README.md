# RFID-based-attendance-system-C-
An innovative and sustainable design of embedded system is proposed for the attendance system. The system is based on the RFID technology. The whole system consists of 2 main modules. One is the hardware device and other one is the software application. Arduino micro-controller is used as a main processing unit in the hardware device. While the software application is developed on C# .NET programming platform. Graphical user interface, hyperthreading and socket programming are options that are in available easily in C# programming platform. As a project, a whole package for attendance system is developed which has potential to use it on a commercial level.
